## Mapping tool using AddressBase data and Open Geography Portal maps
A tool which takes a table of locations and classifications from AddressBase and plots those locations against whatever boundaries you can think of.
Works well with [Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) maps.

### Instructions: 
Download this repo then open *mapping_tool.ipynb* in Jupyter Notebook (some instructions about how to do this are in the *docs* directory if you're lost). It has been set up with some sample data so you can work through that to see how it works, and for more instructions about making your own maps with the tool read *guide.docx* in the *docs* directory.
